      This policy outlines how Go Ahead Homes will continue to execute the safe delivery of 
our service during this COVID-19 pandemic and what actions will be taken in the event 
of an outbreak within our service.
To date, we have not had any confirmed cases of COVID-19 virus amongst service 
users, staff or their families, and continue to operate our service with minimal 
disruptions as possible in line with governmental guidance. The safety and well-being of 
our service users and staff team is extremely paramount during these times and we are
therefore striving above and beyond to try and keep everyone safe from the effects of 
COVID-19.
This policy has been written in accordance with information and guidance provided from 
the NHS and the UK government officials.
What is COVID-19 / Coronavirus?
As explained by the World Health Organization (WHO), Coronavirus disease (COVID19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered virus.
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate 
respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and 
those with underlying medical problems are more likely to develop serious illness.
The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the 
COVID-19 virus, the disease, its causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others 
from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently and not 
touching your face.
The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the 
nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also 
practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). <br>

      <div class="card-body container">
      <p>
      The main symptoms of coronavirus are:
      <ul>
        <li>a high temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do 
        not need to measure your temperature).</li>
        <li> a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or 
        more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than 
        usual).</li>
        <li>a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste – this means you've noticed you 
        cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to 
        normal.</li>
      </ul>
      Most people with coronavirus have at least 1 of these symptoms <br>
